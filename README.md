## What is Face Detection?
Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images. Face detection also refers to the psychological process by which humans locate and attend to faces in a visual scene.

## What are Haar Cascades?
- Haar Cascade classifiers are an effective way for object detection. 
- Proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features [↗](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3940582_Rapid_Object_Detection_using_a_Boosted_Cascade_of_Simple_Features)
- It is a machine learning-based approach where a lot of positive and negative images are used to train the classifier.
